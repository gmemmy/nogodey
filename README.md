# nogodey

nogodey is a zero-boilerplate localization toolkit for React Native (and any JS/TS project)â€”an esbuild-based AST plugin plus CLI that automatically extracts UI strings, injects __NOGO__() lookups, and manages your translation manifest so you never lose guard on key management or manual wrappers.
